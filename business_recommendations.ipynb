    "### Key Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why these regions?**\n",
    "  - They have **high solar irradiance**, making them ideal for solar generation.\n",
    "  - They show **limited grid access**, indicating a real need for off-grid or supplemental solutions.\n",
    "  - They face **relatively high electricity costs**, making solar alternatives more economically attractive.\n",
    "  - Their **infrastructure index scores** suggest feasible logistics for deploying and maintaining solar installations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What risks or unknowns remain?**\n",
    "  - Terrain ruggedness may pose challenges for transportation and panel installation.\n",
    "  - Local policies, land ownership issues, or socio-political conditions may impact feasibility.\n",
    "  - The solar irradiance data may not reflect **seasonal or weather variability** that affects actual performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What additional data could improve the analysis?**\n",
    "  - **Historical and seasonal irradiance** patterns for more precise solar potential modeling.\n",
    "  - **Land use and land availability** data to assess physical space for installations.\n",
    "  - **Policy and subsidy frameworks** specific to each region.\n",
    "  - **Community readiness or demand** assessments to gauge adoption potential.\n",
    "  - **Installation and maintenance cost estimates** for deeper cost-benefit analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "These recommendations offer a strategic starting point for pilot projects in regions with both high solar potential and underserved energy needs. Additional field validation and stakeholder engagement are encouraged before deployment.\n"
